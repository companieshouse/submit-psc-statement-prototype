        <li>their verification deadline has passed</li>
        <li>they have reached the limit for the number of extensions they can request</li>

      <p class="govuk-body">{{ data ['pscList']}} still needs to verify their identity and provide their Companies House personal code. </p>

      <p class="govuk-body">If they do not, Companies House may contact them for more information about why they were unable to provide their verification details.</p>     

      <p class="govuk-body">Read the <a href="https://prove-your-identity-prototype.herokuapp.com/release2-v5/pre-one-login/guidance">guidance on verifying your identity for Companies House</a> for more information.</p>

          If a PSC does not comply with identity verification requirements on time, they will be committing an offence and may have to pay a financial penalty or fine. We may also display a note against their name on the public register.
