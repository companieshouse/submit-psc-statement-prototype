        details for its PSCs or RLEs. You will not be able to do it early.
      </p>
        
      <p class="govuk-body">
        The deadline for individual PSCs is 14 days after 
        the confirmation statement date, and RLEs have 28 days.

          If a PSC or RLE does not comply with identity verification 
          requirements, they will be committing an offence and may have to 
          pay a financial penalty or fine. We may also display an annotation
          against their name on the public register.
