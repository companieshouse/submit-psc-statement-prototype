      <p class="govuk-body">Use this service to provide a Companies House personal 
        code for a person with significant control (PSC). This is to confirm that the PSC on our records has verified their identity.
      </p>

      <p class="govuk-body">You can also use this service to:</p> 
      
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>check when a company's PSCs need to provide their personal codes</li>
      <li>request an extension, if a PSC needs more time</li>
      </ul>
  
  <!--
      <p class="govuk-body">You can use this service if you are a PSC, or you are acting on behalf of one.
      </p>
-->

      <p class="govuk-body">You cannot use this service if a PSC has their personal information protected at Companies House (or is waiting for the results of an application).</p>


      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">When you need to provide verification details</h2>
        
      <p class="govuk-body">This is different for everyone, and depends on whether the PSC was registered with Companies House before or after identity verification requirements were introduced on [date].</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">If they were registered as a PSC before [date], they have 14 days starting from the company’s confirmation statement date to provide their personal code. They cannot do it before then.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">If they were registered as a PSC after [date], they have 14 days starting from the date they were registered.</p>

          If a PSC does not comply with identity verification requirements, they will be committing an offence and may have to pay a financial penalty or fine. We may also display a note against their name on the public register.

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Requesting an extension</h2>
      
      <p class="govuk-body">
        If a PSC cannot provide their verification details by their deadline, you may be able to request an extension of 14 days. You need to do this before the PSC's deadline has passed.

  To request an extension, select the ‘Start’ button and sign in to this service.
