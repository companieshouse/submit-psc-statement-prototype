      <h2 id="content-1" class="govuk-heading-m">What identity verification means for PSCs</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">If you are a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/people-with-significant-control-pscs">person with significant control (PSC)</a> of a company, you need to verify your identity for Companies House. This is to confirm that you are who you say you are.</p> 
      <p class="govuk-body">When you’ve successfully verified, you’ll be given a Companies House personal code. You must provide this code so that we can link your verified identity to the correct PSC name on our records.</p> 
      <p class="govuk-body">You only need to verify your identity and get a Companies House personal code once. </p> 
      <p class="govuk-body">However, you need to provide your personal code separately for each role you have at a company. For example, for: </p> 

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>each role you hold at the same company (for example, if you are both a director and a PSC) </li>
        <li>any roles you hold at other companies</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="content-2" class="govuk-heading-m">When and how to verify your identity</h2>
      
      <p class="govuk-body">You can verify your identity for Companies House at any time.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">There are different ways to do this, including: </p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>online using GOV.UK One Login</li>
        <li>in person at the Post Office</li>
        <li>using a Companies House authorised agent (such as an accountant or solicitor)</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="govuk-body">For more information on each of these methods, read the <a href="https://prove-your-identity-prototype.herokuapp.com/release2-v5/pre-one-login/guidance">guidance on verifying your identity for Companies House</a>.</p>    

      <h2 id="content-3" class="govuk-heading-m">When you need to provide your Companies House personal code</h2>
      
      <p class="govuk-body">
        There’s a specific time period for providing your personal code to link your verified identity to the correct PSC name on our records.  
      </p>
        
      <p class="govuk-body">This is different for everyone, and it depends on whether you became a PSC of the company before or after identity verification for Companies House was first introduced on [date].</p>

      <p class="govuk-body"><strong>If you became a PSC before [IDV go live date]</strong></p>

      <p class="govuk-body">You need to wait until the company’s confirmation statement date. You will not be able to provide your personal code before this date.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">You will then have 14 days from the confirmation statement date to provide your personal code.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body"><strong>If you became a PSC after [IDV go live date]</strong></p>

      <p class="govuk-body">You’ll need to provide your personal code within 14 days of the date Companies House accepted your PSC notification filing.</p>
      
      <p class="govuk-body">You can see the deadline dates for a company’s PSCs by signing in to the <a href="start-v2">Provide verification details for a PSC service</a>.</p>

      <!-- <h2 id="content-4" class="govuk-heading-m">What identity verification is needed if the PSC is a company</h2>
      
      <p class="govuk-body">If the PSC is a company, we refer to it as a relevant legal entity (RLE).</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">RLEs need to provide details of a relevant officer, who will need to verify their identity with Companies House.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">The relevant officer must be a director of the entity, or someone whose roles and responsibilities correspond to that of a company director. They must be aged 16 or over.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">The RLE will need to provide the relevant officer’s:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>full name</li>
        <li>date of birth</li>
        <li>Companies House personal code</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="govuk-body">You can do this using the <a href="start-v2">Provide verification details for a PSC or relevant legal entity service</a>.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">Relevant officer information will not be shown on the public register.</p>

      <div class="govuk-warning-text">
        <span class="govuk-warning-text__icon" aria-hidden="true">!</span>
        <strong class="govuk-warning-text__text">
          <span class="govuk-visually-hidden">Warning</span>
          If an RLE does not comply with the requirement to provide information about its relevant officer, all its company directors (or equivalent) will be committing a criminal offence and may have to pay a financial penalty or fine. We may also display an annotation against their name on the public register.
